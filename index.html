    <h1>Personality quiz</h1>
    <p>This is a questionnaire or series of standardized tasks, used to measure personality characteristics.I built this program to compare your characteristics to the animal kingdom.The return values will be:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>lion</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Leopard</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Mangoose</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>This test is NOT meant to be offensive to anyone as my program works by a set of instructions given to the computer to evaluate the inputs of the users,then returns a value as an animal.</p>
    <p>I've noticed the odds of the return value becoming a dog is 1000000:1.My return value was a leopard): .I hope the test was fun(:</p>
    <p>If you would like to take more personality tests,<a href="https://buzzfeed.com">Buzzfeed</a> has a variety of them.ENJOY!
